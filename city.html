<p>The city was developed during <strong>British Malaya </strong>on a piece of 1,200 acres (486 ha) rubber estate (the Effingham Estate) around Old Klang Road to address the overpopulation of the capital Kuala Lumpur in the 1950s.[1] Since 1952, PJ witnessed a dramatic growth in terms of population size and geographical importance. The development of <em>Petaling Jaya </em> commenced in 1952 with the construction of 800 houses centred on the area known as "Old Town" today.</p>

<p> <em>Petaling Jaya </em> is one of the wettest cities in Malaysia. It is warm with an average maximum of 30 degrees Celsius and receives heavy rainfall all year round, roughly more than 3,300 mm (130 in) of average rainfall annually. The city has no particular true dry season, but June and July are the driest months. Mostly each month average rainfall receives more than 200 mm (7.9 in). Thunderstorms and extreme rainstorms are common, and it is one of the highest lightning strike areas in the world. But due to normal global temperature variations, Petaling Jaya is experiencing severe drought with frequent water rationing among neighbourhoods.</p>
